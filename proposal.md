# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

FlackJack

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A variation of Blackjack with different rules.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Blackjack but with special rules. Even value number cards (2,4,6..) are doubled in value each time you draw one. Also, face cards (J, Q, K) add 10 but divides your total by 2 and rounds up (only divides on first hit). Another rule is that if you stop and the number of cards in your hand are even you can add 1 to your total. On the other hand if it is odd you can subract 1. Winning without using this feature gives more points than if you. Example: Your starting hand is a 6 and 9 (total:15). You draw a 2 which stays the same value (total:17). Then you draw a J which adds 10 (total:27) but divided by 2 and rounded (total:14). Now you draw a 4 that now doubles to become 8 (total:22). You end with 5 cards in ur hand so you can subtract 1 from your total or stay (total:21).

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will create a functioning random card drawer.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to create at least a normal game of Blackjack.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to create Blackjack but with the features I previously described.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps would be to start working on the project and see what I need to learn. I will research things that I don't know how to do and apply them to the project. Skills that I might need would be to insert graphics and make things look polished. Things that might be troubling are aces which can be either valued as 1 or 11 depending on what the player chooses. Overall, I think the cards themselves will the hardest part.
